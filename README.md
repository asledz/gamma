# gamma
Project for MIMUW C class.

## About the project

The project consisted of 3 parts. The goal was to create a gamma game. In this game, player play on a rectangle board, taking up the fields that are already free. The only limit for a player is about the number of areas(connected fields) on the board. 

Project is documented in polish, as it was a University project.

### Parts

Part one goal was to implement the interface of [gamma](https://github.com/asledz/gamma/blob/main/src/gamma.h)
### Part 2.
Part two goal was to implement two modes: interactive one (activated by line "I (board_width) (board_height) (number_of_players) (areas_limit)\n" on input). and batch one (activated by line "B (board_width) (board_height) (number_of_players) (areas_limit)\n" on input).
### Part 3.
Part three goal was to develop existing functionalities, both in a way given and with creativeness.
